<h1>Azure SIEM Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:

I configured Azure Sentinel (a Security Information and Event Management system) and linked it to a live virtual machine designed as a honeypot. This setup enables us to actively monitor real-time attacks, such as RDP Brute Force attempts, originating from diverse global locations. To enhance our insights, we've developed a specialized PowerShell script to retrieve geolocation details of the attackers and display them on the Azure Sentinel Map.

Key Objectives:        
The key objectives of this initiative revolve around setting up and leveraging Azure Sentinel as a robust Security Information and Event Management system. This entails establishing a live virtual machine configured as a honeypot to actively monitor and analyze real-time cyber threats, with a specific focus on RDP Brute Force attacks originating from global locations. Our primary aim is to enhance threat visibility and incident response capabilities. To achieve this, a custom PowerShell script has been developed to extract geolocation information from the attackers and present it on the Azure Sentinel Map. By fulfilling these objectives, we aim to strengthen our cybersecurity posture, proactively identify threats, and fortify our defenses against potential security breaches.
